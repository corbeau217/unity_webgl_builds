# Unity WebGL Builds
## About
* for inclusion as a submodule in the [website repo](https://github.com/corbeau217/corbeau217.github.io)
## Notes
* github pages doesnt yet enjoy content encoding shenanigans and having projects be uncompressed increases the load times significantly
* we'll mostly tend towards using itch.io where possible for the builds, and revisit in page building later.
